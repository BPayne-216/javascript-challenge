This project used javascript to query a given field (table) of UFO data.  HTML, css, andbootstrap were used to create the website.

The motivation of this project is to create an interactive website that allows the visitor to the site to query the table information based on: date/time, city, state, country, shape.
Level I: this allows visitor to query by typing in the date and retrieving all table elements that match that date.
Level II: this is an interactive filter that allows the visitor to query the table elements based on (5) elements: date/time, city, state, country, and shape.  A button creates the query and any combination of the (5) filters may be utilized.

Build status: the initial project was given the data (array), html, starter javascript code.  The main objective was to create filters based on the data that allowed for queries based on date/time and multiple filters.
